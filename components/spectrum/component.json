I had tried a number of existing plugins, but decided to try and make a smaller, simpler one.\n\nI started using canvas, then switched to CSS gradients, since it turned out to be easier to manage, and provided better cross browser support.\n\nSpectrum is registered as a jQuery plugin on the jQuery plugin repository here: http://plugins.jquery.com/spectrum/\n\nThanks to the following places for good information as this plugin was being built:\n\n* http://ansciath.tumblr.com/post/7347495869/css-aspect-ratio: Aspect ratio using CSS only\n* https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiColorPicker for saturation/value gradient constants\n* http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/HueScale.svg: For hue gradient contants\n",
